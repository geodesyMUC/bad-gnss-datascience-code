# bad-gnss-datascience-code

This project is showing bad coding practices that are commonly seen in GNSS data science projects.

Written in Python 3.10.10.

# Description

The `app.py` is a script that plots data from a file named `sample_data.csv`. It contains a few bad coding practices such as:

- Import statements using `from LIBRARY import *`
- Inconsistent whitespace between operators and after comma
- Try-catch blocks without catching specific exceptions
- Meaningless comments
- No functions, some duplicate code
- Bad variable names that are not descriptive at all
- Inconsistent variable naming conventions (camelCase, snake_case)
- Bad `elif` condition
- etc.
